Patient (id, supabaseId, dateOfBirth, gender, phone, address, medicalHistory, profile_picture_url)
Doctor (id, supabaseId, specialization, phone, address)
Appointment (id, patientId, doctorId, date, time, type, notes, status)
Prescription (id, patientId, doctorId, medication, dosage, instructions)
MedicalRecord (id, patientId, title, description, fileUrl, fileType, fileName, size, uploadedAt)
```

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] JWT token validation
- [x] Role-based access control
- [x] Secure session management
- [x] Automatic token cleanup
- [x] Patient-specific data isolation

### File Security
- [x] File type validation
- [x] Size limit enforcement
- [x] Unique file naming (UUID)
- [x] Organized storage structure
- [x] Temporary file cleanup

### Data Protection
- [x] Patient data isolation
- [x] Secure file URLs
- [x] Database record validation
- [x] Error handling without data exposure

## Known Issues & Solutions

### RLS Policy Issue
**Problem**: Supabase Storage RLS policies cause upload failures when set to authenticated users.

**Current Workaround**: Set buckets to public for uploads to work.

**Root Cause**: Server-side uploads don't have proper authentication context for RLS policies.

**Recommended Solutions**:
1. **Service Role Key**: Use service role key for server-side uploads
2. **Proper RLS Policy**: Implement correct authentication context
3. **Client-Side Upload**: Upload directly from frontend (alternative)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- Supabase account
- Environment variables configured

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_url
DIRECT_URL=your_postgresql_direct_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Supabase Setup
1. Create project in Supabase
2. Create storage buckets:
   - `profile-pictures` (public)
   - `medical-records` (public)
3. Configure RLS policies (see known issues)

## Testing
